# HW6-Weather-Dashboard
A ReadME containing my HW6 - Weather Dashboard submission.  Contains a description, a link to the application, and a screenshot.

1) Description: This is a weather dashboard application that gets data from a server-side API (specifically, OpenWeather API) in order to display pertinent weather information for a chosen city.  The info includes the city's name, current date, current weather, and the forecast for the next 5 days.  The page also includes a search bar and search history.

2) Link to deployed application: https://bkim377.github.io/HW5-Weather-Dashboard/
